Below is a detailed analysis of each frontend component and page required for the admin side of the NextGen Task Management (NEGTM) system, focusing on what should be present to enable full interaction with the user side. The goal is to ensure administrators can effectively manage users, tasks, goals, files, and reports while maintaining a light-mode interface with a bright teal and blue color scheme. Each component and page is analyzed based on its purpose, the elements it should include, and how it facilitates admin interaction with user-side data, without creating or designing the code yet.

### Next Steps
I’ve outlined the necessary details for each frontend component and page, focusing on their purpose, elements, and interaction with the user side. Please confirm if this analysis meets your expectations or if you’d like me to refine any specific details. Additionally, let me know if you want to:
- Proceed with creating the code for these components using React, styled with Tailwind CSS or another library to implement the teal/blue light-mode theme.
- Prioritize specific components or pages for creation.
- Provide mock data structures for testing the frontend without the backend.
- Discuss additional features or design considerations.

I’ll wait for your response before moving forward!
